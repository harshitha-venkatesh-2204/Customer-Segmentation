# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering with PCA Dimensionality Reduction

This repository contains the source code and analysis for a customer segmentation project using **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. The project, conducted in association with the **University of Pittsburgh**, aims to identify distinct customer segments based on spending and demographic data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a customer segmentation model that helps categorize clients into meaningful groups. By analyzing spending habits and demographic data, this model reveals key customer profiles that can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning and transforming raw customer data.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features to capture spending behavior and demographic patterns.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Using **PCA** to reduce the number of features while retaining maximum variance.
4. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Applying **K-Means Clustering** to identify distinct customer groups.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizing clusters to interpret key customer profiles.

## 🚀 Key Insights

By analyzing the data and clustering it, the model identifies **four key customer segments**:
- **Segment 1**: High-income families with large spending capacity.
- **Segment 2**: Budget-conscious customers with moderate spending.
- **Segment 3**: Young professionals with high single-person expenditure.
- **Segment 4**: Large families with diverse spending needs.

These profiles are instrumental for tailoring marketing campaigns and improving customer engagement.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering and PCA.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization of clusters and customer segments.


📈 Results
The clustering results provide detailed insights into customer spending habits, allowing businesses to design more focused and effective marketing strategies. Each customer segment represents unique traits, helping companies understand their diverse clientele better.
